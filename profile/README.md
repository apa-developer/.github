# 🏰 Apa Developer: What is "Apa"? What is the Point?

Greetings, noble wanderers of the digital realm! 👑

## **What is "Apa"?**

The name "Apa" originates from the Indonesian language, meaning "What?" (pronounced **ah-pah**).  
It reflects the essence of our organization: the pursuit of understanding, exploration, and discovery that begins with the simplest, yet most profound, question—**What?**

> **Our vision** is to foster a creative space for builders, dreamers, and thinkers to ask questions boldly and uncover answers together.
